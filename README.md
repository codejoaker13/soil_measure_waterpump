Soil Measure Water Pump is a project that involves a smart irrigation system that senses the amount of moisture in the soil and turns on the water pump when the soil is dry so that the plants always get the right amount of water. This one is based around a soil moisture sensor that checks the moisture content of the soil and when the soil becomes too dry it turns on a water pump. Well, it does include an Arduino or some other microcontroller to collect sensor data and control the pump. It conserves water because it only waters when it needs it so it is great for small gardens, greenhouses, or even large farms. It's kind of like a vault for all the code and wiring schematics and setup explanations, for all the do it yourselfers.
